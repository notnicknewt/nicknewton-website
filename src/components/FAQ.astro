        Questions you're probably asking
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <!-- FAQ 1 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "I don't have time."
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            You stay up till 4am for launches. You have time. You just haven't made this a priority. The system is built for busy operators... async check-ins, training that fits your schedule, nutrition that works around client dinners.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 2 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "I've tried everything."
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            You've tried DIY. You haven't tried a system with real accountability. Gym memberships, apps, trainers you cancelled on more than you showed up for... that's not "everything." That's winging it with extra steps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 3 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "I'll start when things calm down."
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            Things won't calm down. Business isn't designed to. There's always another launch, another fire, another "busy season." The guys who get results start despite the chaos, not after it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 4 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "I can do it myself."
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            You delegate your taxes, your ads, your ops. Why are you winging the one thing that powers everything else? You wouldn't run your business without systems and accountability. Why run your body that way?
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 5 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "What if it doesn't work?"
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            If you show up and do the work, it works. The system is proven. The question is whether you'll actually follow through, and that's exactly what the accountability is for.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FAQ 6 -->
        <div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-text mb-3">
            "How is this different from other coaches?"
          </h3>
          <p class="text-brand-muted">
            Most coaches tell you what you want to hear. I tell you what you need to hear. Kind, not nice. I track patterns, call out excuses, and won't let you forget what you said you wanted.
