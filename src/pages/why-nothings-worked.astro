					It's not willpower. It's one of three patterns.

					<div class="bg-brand-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-brand-accent/20">
						<p class="text-brand-accent font-semibold text-lg mb-4">"I know what to do. I can't make myself do it."</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							You've got the gym membership. You've got the plan saved somewhere. You know exactly what you should be doing.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							But you can't make yourself start.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							Monday comes and goes. Next week. Next month. After this project. When things calm down.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							Planning becomes the action. Researching feels like progress. But you never actually begin.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-text font-semibold">
							It's not laziness. If it were, you wouldn't have built what you've built. Something's blocking the start. And willpower isn't going to fix it.

						<p class="text-brand-accent font-semibold text-lg mb-4">"I start strong. Then life happens."</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							You've started before. Plenty of times.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							First few weeks are great. Gym before work. Meals on point. You remember why you wanted this.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							Then something happens. A client melts down. A deal goes sideways. The week piles up.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							And you fall off. Not dramatically. Just quietly. One skipped session becomes two. The meal prep stops. Before you know it, it's been two months.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-text font-semibold">
							Reset. Start again. Same cycle. Three weeks on. Two months off. Repeat for years.

						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							You're actually doing it. Three, four times a week. You show up.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							But the mirror hasn't changed. Maybe in months. Maybe in years.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							Different program. Different split. More volume. Less volume. Nothing moves.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-muted mb-4">
							Or you're grinding but you've got nothing left. Dragging yourself through workouts. Weights feel heavier than they should.
						</p>
						<p class="text-brand-text font-semibold">
							You're in motion. But you're not making progress.

						Your system is broken. Not you... the approach.
